Differentiation

Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that involves finding the rate of change of a function at a given point.
It is represented by the derivative of the function, which is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point.
The derivative can be calculated using various techniques, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
